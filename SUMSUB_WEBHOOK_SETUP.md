# Sumsub Webhook Setup Guide

## üìã Prerequisites

- Sumsub account with admin access
- Your server must be accessible via HTTPS
- Your webhook endpoint must be publicly reachable

## üîß Step-by-Step Setup

### 1. Access Sumsub Dashboard

1. Log into your Sumsub account
2. Navigate to **Settings** ‚Üí **Webhooks** (or **Developer Tools** ‚Üí **Webhooks**)

### 2. Create New Webhook

1. Click **"Add Webhook"** or **"Create Webhook"**
2. Configure the following settings:

#### **Basic Configuration**

### 3. Webhook Configuration Details

#### **Authentication**

- Sumsub will send signature headers for verification
- Headers: `X-App-Access-Ts` and `X-App-Access-Sig`
- Our code automatically verifies these signatures

#### **Webhook Payload Structure**

Based on [Sumsub documentation](https://docs.sumsub.com/docs/user-verification-webhooks):

```json
{
  "applicantId": "unique_applicant_id",
  "externalUserId": "your_user_id",
  "levelName": "basic-kyc-level",
  "type": "applicantReviewed",
  "reviewResult": {
    "reviewAnswer": "GREEN"
  },
  "reviewStatus": "completed"
}
```

### 4. Environment-Specific URLs

#### **Development**

```
https://your-dev-domain.com/api/sumsub/webhook
```

#### **Production**

```
https://your-prod-domain.com/api/sumsub/webhook
```

### 5. Verify Configuration

1. Check webhook status shows "Active" or "Enabled"
2. Look for any delivery errors in the dashboard
3. Test the webhook if Sumsub provides a test feature

## üîç Testing the Setup

### 1. Test Webhook Endpoint

Use the "Test Webhook URL" button in the user dropdown to verify your endpoint is accessible.

### 2. Monitor Console Logs

When you start verification, look for these logs:

- `=== WEBHOOK ENDPOINT HIT ===`
- `üÜï Applicant created webhook received!`
- `‚úÖ Updated user with real applicantId`

### 3. Expected Webhook Flow

1. **Start verification** ‚Üí User gets temporary applicantId
2. **Submit documents** ‚Üí `applicantCreated` webhook received
3. **Documents pending** ‚Üí `applicantPending` webhook received
4. **Verification completed** ‚Üí `applicantReviewed` webhook received

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Issues

### **Webhook Not Receiving Calls**

1. Check webhook URL is correct and accessible
2. Verify HTTPS is enabled
3. Check server firewall settings
4. Look for webhook delivery errors in Sumsub dashboard

### **Signature Verification Failing**

1. Verify `SUMSUB_SECRET_KEY` environment variable is correct
2. Check webhook URL path matches exactly
3. Ensure timestamp and signature headers are present

### **User Not Found**

1. Check if `externalUserId` matches between creation and webhook
2. Verify temporary applicantId is being saved correctly
3. Look for applicantId matching in webhook logs

## üß™ Debugging Commands

```bash
curl -X GET https://your-domain.com/api/sumsub/webhook/test
```
